## Introduction

Fake news is a type of disinformation or misinformation that is deliberately created to deceive or manipulate readers. Detecting fake news has become increasingly important in the age of information overload. This project aims to identify and classify news articles as fake or real using NLP techniques. It employs pre-trained language models and machine learning algorithms to make these classifications.

## Dependencies

Before you can run the code, you need to ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided example)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file included in this repository.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Fake News Dataset from Example Dataset Source. It contains a collection of news articles labeled as either fake or real. The dataset is provided in CSV format and is stored in the data directory.

Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Please download the dataset from the provided source, or if you have your own dataset, ensure that it is properly formatted with text content and labels.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meenatchii/Nanmuthalvan-AI-Project.git
```

cd fake-news-detection
## Usage
Data Preprocessing: You may need to preprocess the data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization. If you have specific preprocessing requirements, you can perform them in a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script.

Training: Train the NLP model using the preprocessed data. You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook (train_fake_news_detection_model.ipynb) as a reference or adapt the code in your own Python script. Training involves selecting an appropriate NLP model, fine-tuning it, and saving the trained model weights.

Inference: Use the trained model to make predictions on new news articles. The provided Jupyter Notebook (detect_fake_news.ipynb) can be used as a reference.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can use the sklearn.metrics module to calculate these metrics.

## Example
An example Jupyter Notebook (example.ipynb) is provided in this repository to help you get started with using the code for fake news detection. You can use this notebook as a reference and customize it for your specific dataset and requirements.
